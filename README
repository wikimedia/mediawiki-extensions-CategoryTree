The CategoryTree extension provides a dynamic view of the wiki's category
structure as a tree. It uses AJAX to load parts of the tree on demand.

The CategoryTree extension was originally written by Daniel Kinzler in
2006 and is released under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL). The 
internationalization files contain contributions by several people;
they are mentioned in each file individually. Also thanks to Tim Starling
for his contributions.


INSTALLING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Copy the CategoryTree directory into the extensions folder of your 
MediaWiki installation. Then add the following lines to your
LocalSettings.php file (near the end):

  $wgUseAjax = true;
  require_once( 'extensions/CategoryTree/CategoryTree.php' );
  
Note that $wgUseAjax = true; will enable the ajax framework in MediaWiki,
which is required by the CategoryTree extension. AJAX is a term for using
JavaScript to load parts of a page on demand. It is supported by all
recent graphic web browsers. For more information about AJAX see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29>.


USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

CategoryTree can be used in three ways: directly on the category pages,
as a "custom tag" to show a category structure inline on a wiki page, 
and as a special page.

The CategoryTree extension replaces the subcategory section of category
pages with a dynamic tree view. If Javascript is disabled, this appears
as a plain list. The dynamic subcategory entries can be disabled using
the URL parameter "notree" - this is intended for bots that rely on
parsing the HTML of category pages.

The custom tag is called <categorytree>. For example, if you put
<categorytree>Foo</categorytree> on a wiki page, it will show the contents
of category Foo as a dynamic tree on that page. The tag accepts three
attributes, using a HTML-like syntax:

* hideroot - set this to "on" to hide the "root" node of the tree, i.e.
             the mention of category Foo from the example.
             
* mode - can be "categories" (the default), "pages" or "all". "categories"
         only lists subcategories; "pages" lists all pages in the category
         except images; "all" shows all pages in the category.
         
* style - can be used to specify any CSS styles you would like for the
          tree.
          
The special page is called Special:CategoryTree; there you can enter the
name of a category and then browse it's content. The CategoryTree
extension also adds a tab for this special page to every category page.

          
OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some options you can specify in your LocalSettings.php file:

$wgCategoryTreeMaxChildren - maximum number of children shown in a tree
                             node. Default is 200
                             
$wgCategoryTreeAllowTag - enable <categorytree> tag. Default is true.

$wgCategoryTreeDynamicTag - loads the first level of the tree in a 
                            <categorytag> dynamically. This way, the cache
                            does not need to be disabled. Default is false
                             
$wgCategoryTreeDisableCache - disabled the parser cache for pages with a
                              <categorytree> tag. Default is true.

$wgCategoryTreeHTTPCache - enable HTTP cache for anon users. Default is
                          false.
